# Question.1- Write a program to display: 1.Value, 2.Type, 3.Memory address using appropriate built-in functions

# Question.2 - What is difference between : 
# a = 10
# b = 10
# and
# a = [10]
# b = [10]
# Explain usind id()

# Question.3 - What does the id() function return ?
# Is the value returned by id() same for two variables holding the same value?

# Question.4 - What is the purpose of getsizeof() ?
# Why is memory size different for different data types ?

# Question.5 - Predict the output:
 
# a = 10
# b = 10
# print(id(a) == id(b))
# Explain why this happens.

# Question.6 - Write a program that accepts two numbers from user and print their:
# Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Division

# Question.7- Why does the input() function always return a string?
# How can you convert it to another data type?

# Question.8- predict the output:
# x = input("Enter number: ")
# print(type(x))
# Explain the reason.

# Question.9- Write a program to take the user's name and age and display: 
# Hello <name>, you will turn <age+1> next year.

# Question.10- What will be the output:
