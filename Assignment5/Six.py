# Predict the output:
x = None
print(type(x))
print(x == False)
# Explain the result.

# The output of the code will be:
# <class 'NoneType'>
# False
# In Python, None is a special constant that represents the absence of a value or a null value. When we use the type() function on None, it returns <class 'NoneType'>, indicating that None is of the NoneType data type.
# When we compare None to False using the equality operator (==), the result is False. This is because None and False are distinct values in Python. 
# None signifies 'no value' or 'nothing', while False is a boolean value representing logical falsehood. Therefore, they are not considered equal in a comparison.
