# What is dynamic typing in Python?

# Answer:
# Dynamic typing in Python refers to the ability of the language to determine the type of a variable at runtime, rather than at compile time. This means that you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable when you create it; instead, Python infers the type based on the value assigned to the variable.
# For example, you can assign an integer value to a variable and later reassign a string value to the same variable without any type declaration or conversion. This flexibility allows for rapid development and prototyping, as developers can focus on writing code without worrying about strict type definitions.
# However, dynamic typing also means that type-related errors may only be caught at runtime, which can lead to potential bugs if not carefully managed. To mitigate this, developers often use type hints and static analysis tools to improve code quality while still benefiting from Python's dynamic typing features.
